1. Problem Analysis
-------------------

Summarize the analysis work you did. 
What new information did it reveal?  How did this help you?
How much time did you spend on problem analysis?

	I didn't have to think about the problem too much. Tic Tac Toe
	was one of my favorite games when I was a child, so I know my
	way around the game. I have a lot of experience programming AI
	for board games as well, so thinking of a solution wasn't too
	hard.

---------
2. Design
---------

Explain the design you developed to use and why. 
What are the major components? What connects to what?
How much time did you spend on design?

	I have a separate class for each type of player, as well as a
	class for the board, a class to evaluate a board's position,
	and a tree that will make implementing the minimax algorithm
	easy.

3. Implementation and Testing
-----------------------------

Describe your implementation efforts here; this is the coding and testing.

What did you put into code first?
	I started by coding all of the necessary classes, like the board
	and the driver class.

How did you test it?
	I tested it by playing against it myself, and trying to push it
	into positions where it would make a mistake. I then figured out
	why it made the mistake, then fixed it. I did this until it worked
	perfectly.

How well does the solution work?
	My solutions work very well. My moderate AI, which I used for
	experimentation, can pick the best move most of the time without
	needing to look ahead. My good AI can pick the absolute best
	move every time almost instantly on the 3x3 board, and search
	far enough into the larger  boards to get an extremely good
	idea of what the best move is.

Does it completely solve the problem?
	I think my program solves the problem sufficiently.
	
Is anything missing?
	I don't think there's anything missing. The game does everything
	required by this project, and more.

How could you do it differently?
	I could probably optimize the code a little.

How could you improve it?
	There's not much to improve, but I could optimize some of the code
	to make the minimax able to search a bit deeper in the same amount
	of time, but the improvements in the AI would be negligible.

How much total time would you estimate you worked on the project? 
	I spent two days on this. I spent about two hours the day the project
	was assigned setting up all of the main classes, then spent the next
	few weeks thinking about how I would implement the code, then I
	wrote the rest of the code the day before the assignment was due.

If you had to do this again, what would you do differently?
	I wouldn't do this project any differently. This project was very
	successful for me, and I can't think of many ways to improve it.

4. Development Process
----------------------

Describe your development process here; this is the overall process.

How much problem analysis did you do before your initial coding effort?
	I thought about the problem on my way to and from classes, and on my
	free time.

How much design work and thought did you do before your initial coding effort?
	I didn't do much design work. I thought about the problem occasionally
	and let ideas and solutions pop into my head.

How many times did you have to go back to assess the problem?
	I didn't have to assess the problem many times.

What did you learn about software development?
	I learned that software development can be fun when you enjoy
	the task at hand.
